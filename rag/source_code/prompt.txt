My goal is to break down the finite element method used to solve Maxwell's equations in 3D into small parts that can be worked on individually. This will allow me to understand the individual parts that must be implemented in a large FEM porgram. This program with be in 3D and it will simulate the propogation of electromagnetic radiation that passes through heterogenious material. The program should take in a mesh file, it won't produce one itself. Your job is to break down all the steps of the finite element method as they relate to this specific problem, into parts that can later be implemented separately. Focus on breaking down the complex finite element problems into smaller manageable pieces. Each of these pieces should be small enough so that they can be implemented in small functions, understood easily, and easy to debug. Aim for around 10 pieces. Remember to focus on small steps that can become small functions that break the problem down into its basic tasks. This program will use PETSc to create the FEM algorithm, and will NOT use libraries like fenics or dealii. Don't include code, just include a number following by a title for the piece, and a short explanation. Focus on simple tried-and-true methods, and don't overly complicate things. Do not rewrite things that PETSc can already do.
