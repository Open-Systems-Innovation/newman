A finite element code is a complicated program but it can be broken down into smaller manageable pieces. These pieces can be translated into function calls for the code. PETSc is a library that allows helps the user solve a finite element problem by giving the user a toolkit that they can use to create finite element algorithms. I want to solve a hyperbolic conservation equation of electromagnetic energy propagating through heterogeneous material. Breakdown this problem into many steps and create a code scaffolding for this algorithm.
